Issue 1: Critical Data Pipeline Failure Before Major Data Refresh
Root Cause Analysis (RCA) & Incident Reporting
Create an Issue:

Open an incident issue on GitHub, documenting the failure details, including error messages and logs.
Tag relevant team members using @mentions and assign the issue to relevant stakeholders.
Set the priority level and milestone for tracking progress and resolution timelines.
Initial Investigation via Monitoring Tools

Task: Investigate using Azure Data Factory (ADF) monitoring tools.
Upon discovering that the pipeline execution exceeded the allowed time (6+ hours), log this finding in the GitHub issue. Link the stored procedure (SP) responsible for the bottleneck, ensuring that all team members have visibility into the problematic code by referencing its location in the repository.
Debugging & Query Analysis

Action: Clone the repository and retrieve the SP from the GitHub repo.
Conduct code review and debugging in a feature branch. Commit your findings, mentioning no deadlocks or concurrent issues. Highlight potential performance bottlenecks (e.g., large update queries) using code comments and TODO notes.
Optimization Strategy

Branch: Create a new branch (fix/optimize-batch-processing) to test the recommended switch from bulk updates to batch processing.
Push the changes to the branch and open a Pull Request (PR), ensuring to describe the changes, the expected outcome, and the reason behind adopting batch processing (e.g., smaller transactions for performance improvements).
Assign reviewers for code review and testing.
Implementing Batch Processing

Update the stored procedure in the new branch to process batches of 10,000 records at a time.
Commit the updates and push to the branch. Include unit tests and SQL performance metrics in the commit history.
Performance Improvement

Merge the PR after approval.
In the commit message, mention that the execution time was reduced by 97.22%, from 6 hours to 10 minutes. Update the issue to reflect the successful resolution, closing it once verified in production.
Issue 2: Data Pipeline Performance Optimization
Task: Analyze Pipeline Setup and Identify Bottlenecks
Branch: Create a new branch (feature/pipeline-optimization) for pipeline improvements.

Review Configuration in Repo: Analyze current pipeline configuration stored in the repository.

Update the pipeline definition file (YAML, JSON, etc.) to increase the copy parallelism setting.
Adjust Data Integration Units (DIUs) based on actual workload requirements.
Code Review & Testing

Commit the changes and create a PR. In the PR description, document the reasoning behind these changes, specifically optimizing copy parallelism and DIU settings to match workload requirements.
Attach performance metrics and pipeline run history for tracking improvements.
Assign appropriate team members for code review and testing in a development environment.
Merge & Monitor

After successful testing, merge the PR into the main branch.
Create a GitHub action or pipeline trigger to monitor performance post-deployment and automatically log metrics (pipeline duration, DIU consumption, task completion rates) as issues for future review.
Issue 3: Data Cleaning and Transformation for a Large Dataset
Task: Extract and clean archived financial data.

Branch: Create a branch (feature/data-cleaning) and push the relevant data extraction scripts and ETL logic to the repository.
Ensure to add filters and data validation checks (such as the DWRecordState flag) to ensure only the latest records are fetched.
Data Cleaning Commit:

Commit the data cleaning and transformation steps, documenting the approach used in the commit messages.
Include any transformations and sorting logic, and reference relevant files in the repo where data flow activities are defined.
Result & Documentation:

After running and validating the ETL pipeline, push results and metrics to the repo.
Document the process in the README.md file for future reference.
Issue 4: Designing a Pipeline for Multiple Data Sources
Task: Integrate data from various sources (JSON, CSV, Excel, NoSQL, APIs) into a unified pipeline.

Branch: Create a feature branch (feature/multi-source-integration) to handle the ingestion and transformation logic.
Add connectors and configurations for each data source in the relevant pipeline definition files (JSON, YAML, etc.). Push these files to the branch.
Transformation and Wrangling:

Commit data wrangling scripts and transformations in notebooks or data flow logic.
Ensure each commit contains descriptive messages about the schema mapping, validation rules, and conversion to Parquet format.
PR and Review:

Push changes, open a PR, and assign reviewers.
In the PR, describe the approach for handling schema differences, and link to any design docs or schema mappings stored in the repo.
Issue 5: Handling Missing or Inconsistent Data
Manual Backfill Pipeline:

Create a new branch (feature/manual-backfill-pipeline) and push the backfill configuration and pipeline setup to the repository.
Update the configuration table and script with comments that guide the manual execution process.
Result Tracking:

Add logging mechanisms for backfill steps and push a commit that includes a reporting script for daily transaction validation.
Reference the health and hygiene report in the README.md for team visibility.
