## Question 1: How would you handle a situation where a critical data pipeline failed just before a major data refresh? Walk me through your troubleshooting process.

1. **Root Cause Analysis (RCA) & Incident Reporting:**
   - The first step is to initiate a Root Cause Analysis (RCA). I would create an incident ticket and immediately communicate this via a high-level email to the leadership team, ensuring they have visibility into the issue and the steps being taken to resolve it.

2. **Initial Investigation via Monitoring Tools:**
   - I would begin by checking the Azure Data Factory (ADF) Monitor tab to identify the error. Upon review, I discovered that the pipeline wasn’t failing due to any specific issue but was instead terminated by the server due to a prolonged execution time of 6 hours for a single table operation.

3. **Debugging & Query Analysis:**
   - With the stored procedure (SP) name in hand, I would retrieve the latest code version from the repository (GitHub) and initiate the debugging process. Despite finding no immediate errors, I performed additional checks to determine if there were any deadlocks or concurrent processes using the same table. However, no such issues were detected. I then hypothesized that the long execution time was likely due to a heavy update statement within the SP itself, which could have contributed to blocking.

4. **Table Characteristics & Optimization Strategy:**
   - The table in question, OnTimePerformance, is a large dataset with around 1-16 events per shipment ID and approximately 200 columns. Such a structure makes bulk updates resource-intensive and a potential bottleneck for the SQL server. To mitigate this, I recommended shifting from bulk updates to batch processing.

5. **Implementing Batch Processing:**
   - I modified the update query to implement batch processing, where we update 10,000 records at a time and then proceed to the next set of 10,000. This method not only improves performance but also addresses potential issues related to transaction consistency. If a bulk update fails, the entire transaction could be rolled back, risking data loss. With batch processing, any failure would only impact the last 10,000 records, minimizing overall impact.

6. **Performance Improvement Outcome:**
   - By adopting batch processing, I was able to reduce the execution time of the stored procedure from 6 hours to just 10 minutes—a significant performance boost of approximately 97.22%.

## Question 2: Can you provide an example of a time when you had to optimize a data pipeline for better performance? What metrics did you track to determine its success?

- **Situation:** In my previous role as a Data Engineer, I was responsible for managing an Azure Data Factory (ADF) pipeline that processed data from multiple sources into our central data warehouse. The pipeline was crucial for ensuring that data was available for our analytics team in a timely manner. However, we noticed that the pipeline’s processing time had become increasingly sluggish, leading to delays in reporting and affecting business decision-making.

- **Task:** I was assigned the task of optimizing the pipeline's performance. The goal was to significantly reduce the processing time while ensuring that the changes remained cost-effective. Additionally, I needed to maintain the integrity and quality of the data being ingested and transformed, as any compromise could lead to inaccuracies in our reporting.

- **Action:**
  1. I started by thoroughly analyzing the pipeline’s existing setup using ADF’s monitoring tools. I found that the degree of copy parallelism was set too low, meaning the pipeline was not leveraging Azure’s resources effectively. Essentially, the pipeline was processing data in a sequential manner rather than taking advantage of Azure's capability to process multiple activities simultaneously.
  2. To address this, I:
      - Increased the degree of copy parallelism, enabling the pipeline to run multiple data ingestion and transformation activities concurrently. This allowed us to fully utilize Azure’s distributed computing power and sped up the overall processing time.
      - Reviewed the Data Integration Unit (DIU) settings. Initially, the DIUs were configured uniformly across all stages of the pipeline, leading to inefficiencies where some activities were either over-provisioned or underutilized. By adjusting the DIU settings to align with the actual workload of each specific transformation activity, I was able to optimize resource usage effectively. For example, I assigned higher DIU values to data transformations involving large datasets, while reducing them for smaller, less resource-intensive tasks.

- **Result:** These optimizations led to a 45% reduction in overall pipeline processing time, ensuring that the data was available for the analytics team much earlier than before. I closely monitored several metrics, such as pipeline duration, resource utilization, parallel task completion rates, and DIU consumption, to track the effectiveness of these changes. The improvements not only accelerated the processing time but also balanced resource usage and costs efficiently, creating a scalable solution for future growth.

## Question 3: Describe a situation where you had to clean and transform a large dataset. What steps did you take to ensure accuracy and efficiency?

- **Situation:** In my role at the company, we maintain financial data in our data mart for up to two years for analytics purposes. Data older than two years is archived to blob storage. However, clients occasionally request access to their historical financial data for comprehensive analysis. On one occasion, a client requested their entire historical financial dataset, which was archived in blob storage.

- **Task:** The task was to extract, clean, and transform this large dataset from the blob storage to provide the client with the accurate and specific financial records they needed. The challenge was that our data structure uses a Type 2 Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD) approach, which maintains all historical records based on the state of a DWRecordState flag.

- **Action:**
  1. **Data Extraction:** I utilized data flow activities within our ETL tool to extract the data from the Finance Folder in blob storage, which contained weekly files for various clients. I applied filters to ensure only the relevant data for the specific client was retrieved.
  2. **Filtering and Transformation:** Since the client required only the most recent shipment records, I applied additional filters based on the DWRecordState flag (DWRecordState = 1) to isolate the latest active records while excluding redundant historical data that was not necessary from the client’s perspective.
  3. **Data Cleaning and Aggregation:** To prepare the data for the client’s analysis, I performed various operations such as sorting, aggregating, and ranking the records. This process ensured the data was organized and summarized accurately.
  4. **Loading Data to Client-Specific Folder:** Finally, I transformed and loaded the cleaned dataset into a designated client-specific folder in the blob storage for secure access.

- **Result:** These steps ensured that the client received a clean, accurate, and efficient dataset that matched their criteria and allowed them to perform their analytics seamlessly. By applying filtering and transformation techniques, I optimized the process to handle the large volume of data effectively, maintaining both accuracy and efficiency throughout.

## Question 4: Tell me about a project where you had to integrate data from multiple sources with different schemas. How did you design the pipeline to accommodate these variations?

- **Situation:** In my role, I was assigned a project that involved integrating data from multiple sources, each with different formats and schemas. The data came in various forms, including JSON, CSV, Excel files, and also from NoSQL databases and APIs. The challenge was to build a pipeline that could accommodate these variations and transform the data into a unified format suitable for our data warehouse.

- **Task:** The objective was to design a robust ETL pipeline that could handle the ingestion, transformation, and loading of diverse datasets into our data warehouse efficiently. The end goal was to structure the data into Parquet files, as they are optimized for performance and storage, making them easier and faster to process while ensuring accuracy.

- **Action:**
  1. **Data Ingestion:** I started by setting up the ingestion pipeline using Azure Data Factory (ADF). We used ADF's data flow tasks to pull data from the different sources: JSON, CSV, Excel files, NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB), and APIs. Each source required a different connector and configuration, but ADF’s flexible integration options made this process manageable.
  2. **Data Transformation and Wrangling:** Given the variety in data structures, I applied data wrangling techniques within ADF’s data flows and, where necessary, used Python notebooks integrated into Azure Synapse Analytics. This step included:
      - **Normalization:** Bringing different formats to a consistent schema by mapping fields and transforming data types.
      - **Cleansing:** Removing duplicates, handling missing values, and ensuring data quality by applying validation rules specific to each dataset.
      - **Aggregation and Structuring:** Aggregating and structuring the data to fit our predefined schema, making it compatible for conversion to Parquet.
  3. **Conversion to Parquet:** Once the data was cleaned and structured, I used data flow tasks to convert each dataset into Parquet format. The Parquet files were then stored in Azure Blob Storage. Parquet’s columnar format and compression ensured efficient storage and fast access times, which was critical for downstream processing.
  4. **Loading into the Data Warehouse:** After converting the data to Parquet, the next step was to load the transformed data into our data warehouse. Using the same pipeline, I mapped and loaded the Parquet files into dimension (Dim) and fact tables. This setup allowed us to create a scalable and consistent structure for analytics and reporting.

- **Result:** The pipeline successfully integrated and transformed data from various sources into a unified format. By leveraging Parquet, we achieved a significant reduction in processing time and storage space. This streamlined the ETL process, ensuring that our analytics platform could efficiently query and report insights with minimal latency. The flexibility of the pipeline also made it easy to add new data sources as the project expanded.

## Question 5: Can you walk me through your experience with cloud-based data warehouse solutions? What challenges have you faced, and how did you overcome them?

- **Experience with Cloud Data Warehousing:**
   - I have hands-on experience working with cloud-based data warehouse solutions, specifically with Azure SQL Data Warehouse (now Azure Synapse Analytics) and Snowflake. Both platforms offer scalable, distributed architectures that allow for fast querying of large datasets.

- **Challenges Faced & Solutions:**
   - **Challenge 1: Handling Large-Scale Data Loads:**
     One of the challenges I encountered was dealing with large-scale data loads into the cloud data warehouse, especially when handling high-frequency transactional data from multiple sources.
     
     **Solution:** To address this, I implemented batch loading processes and leveraged PolyBase to ingest large datasets into Azure Synapse Analytics efficiently. PolyBase allowed for parallel loading of large volumes of data, significantly improving load times. Additionally, I set up Azure Data Factory (ADF) pipelines with monitoring and retry logic to ensure that even if a load failed, it would automatically retry or notify the relevant teams to address the issue.

   - **Challenge 2: Query Optimization in a Distributed Environment:**
     Query performance became an issue when working with large datasets, particularly with complex analytical queries that involved multiple joins across tables.

     **Solution:** To optimize performance, I applied techniques such as partitioning and indexing on large tables. I also used materialized views for frequently accessed data to speed up query performance. Additionally, I implemented query performance monitoring using the Query Performance Insight tool in Azure, which helped identify long-running queries and bottlenecks. From there, I could further optimize the queries or adjust resource allocation accordingly.

   - **Challenge 3: Cost Management in Cloud-Based Data Warehouses:**
     Cloud platforms like Azure and Snowflake charge based on compute and storage usage, so managing costs was a critical challenge.

     **Solution:** To manage costs, I set up auto-scaling and resource optimization techniques, ensuring that we only provisioned compute resources when needed. I also implemented data archiving strategies for historical data, storing it in cheaper storage solutions like Azure Blob Storage when it was no longer required for frequent access, thus reducing costs associated with high-performance storage.

- **Result:** By overcoming these challenges, I was able to ensure that our cloud-based data warehouse solutions were scalable, cost-effective, and performant, which contributed to the overall success of the data platform in supporting our business needs.

## Question 5: Tell me about a time when you encountered missing or inconsistent data in a production system. How did you address the issue?

- **Situation:** In my role, we frequently encountered data lags and inconsistencies in our production system, which required us to create a backfill pipeline manually each time to address the issue. This approach became repetitive and inefficient over time, leading to delays and increased workload.

- **Task:** To resolve this, I proposed and developed a solution that allowed for manual but structured intervention to handle inconsistencies or missing data across multiple tables efficiently, reducing the need for redundant pipeline setups each time.

- **Action:**
    - **Design of the Pipeline:**
        - I designed a pipeline controlled through a configuration table that manually guided the backfill process. This configuration table held the ordered sequence of tables that needed to be checked and processed.
        - If a report flagged inconsistencies in, for example, five tables, I would reference the configuration table to retrieve the source queries (Src Queries) for those specific tables. I then manually executed the necessary steps to backfill these tables in sequence, ensuring accuracy.
    - **Manual Backfill Process:**
        - The pipeline was set up to facilitate a structured manual process where each affected table could be addressed sequentially based on the configuration table. I manually ensured that each table was processed correctly, making necessary adjustments as I went through the sequence.
        - I executed stored procedures according to the next `sp_run` field in the configuration table, which indicated the next step. This ensured that all missing shipment IDs were updated accurately in the dimension (Dim) and fact tables.
    - **Monitoring and Reporting:**
        - To maintain visibility and data quality, I developed a health and hygiene report. This report was manually reviewed and then placed in a shared mailbox each day after I completed the End-to-End (E2E) job.
        - This report allowed me to manually validate the pipeline’s performance and data integrity, ensuring any issues were identified and resolved promptly.

- **Result:** The implementation of this structured approach minimized the repetitive setup of pipelines for backfilling and improved our ability to manage data inconsistencies in a timely manner. The manual reporting mechanism provided a detailed view of the transaction flow, allowing for proactive issue resolution before they affected downstream processes. As a result, the number of data-related incidents reported decreased, and the overall efficiency of our ETL process improved, even with manual intervention.

## Question 6: Can you recall an instance when a script or job you deployed caused unexpected behavior in your data pipeline? How did you identify and fix the issue?

- **Situation:** After migrating our on-premises SQL Server to Azure SQL Database, we noticed that, over time, the database size began to increase significantly. This growth led to delays in data retrieval operations, particularly for SELECT queries, which affected overall performance and user experience.

- **Task:** To address these performance issues, we decided to implement partitioning on the tables. Given the exponential increase in table sizes, partitioning appeared to be the most suitable solution for managing data efficiently and improving job execution times.

- **Action:**
    - **Partitioning Strategy Implementation:**
        - Since our data primarily deals with logistics, we chose to partition the tables based on the `ShipmentDate` field. This decision was informed by our need to manage time-series data efficiently and reduce the impact on the entire table during insert operations. By partitioning by date, new rows could be inserted into the appropriate partition, thereby improving performance.
        - We ensured that our partitioning strategy aligned with partition pruning, a technique where only relevant partitions are scanned during data retrieval, minimizing unnecessary overhead and optimizing I/O operations.
    - **Improvements and Observations:**
        - Partitioning proved beneficial for bulk insert operations, as it allowed us to insert data into specific partitions or create new partitions dynamically when needed. This approach minimized locking and contention, thus enhancing the overall data load time.
        - Initially, data retrieval operations became much faster due to the partition pruning and improved efficiency of accessing smaller segments of data.
    - **Issue Identification:**
        - Despite these initial improvements, we observed that certain jobs were taking longer to complete and encountered frequent locking issues. Through a Root Cause Analysis (RCA), we discovered that the DML (Data Manipulation Language) statements in our stored procedures were running inefficiently due to the increased partition count and the constraints imposed by our limited storage capacity.
        - The tight storage constraints caused fragmentation issues, insufficient space for temporary operations (such as sorting), and reduced I/O throughput, all of which contributed to the slow performance of jobs.
    - **Solution:**
        - To resolve this, the team decided to scale up the SQL Pool by increasing the Data Warehouse Units (DWUs) or Compute Data Units (cDWUs). This provided additional compute resources and expanded storage capacity, effectively alleviating the bottlenecks we had encountered. The increased I/O bandwidth from scaling up the SQL Pool improved both read and write operations, leading to significant performance gains during job runs.
        - Additionally, the team implemented dynamic scaling policies for the SQL Pool. These policies allowed the pool to scale up during peak job times when more resources were needed and scale down during off-peak hours to optimize resource utilization and control costs.

- **Result:** After implementing these changes, job execution times improved significantly, and the overall system performance stabilized. The SQL Pool’s dynamic scaling ensured that future growth and workload fluctuations could be handled efficiently, minimizing the risk of encountering similar issues again. This proactive approach allowed us to maintain the performance benefits of partitioning while managing storage and compute resources effectively.
