## Q1. What is data modeling?

Data modeling is the process of designing the database from scratch by analyzing and defining all the different data types your business collects and produces, as well as the relationships between those bits of data. By using text, symbols, and diagrams, data modeling concepts create visual representations of data as it’s captured, stored, and used at your business. As your business determines how data is used and when, the data modeling process becomes an exercise in understanding and clarifying your data requirements.

## The benefits of data modeling

By modeling your data, you can document what types of data you have, how you use it, and the data management requirements surrounding its usage, protection, and governance. The benefits of data modeling include:

- Creating a structure for collaboration between your IT and business teams.
- Revealing opportunities for improving business processes by defining data needs and uses.
- Saving time and money on IT and process investments through appropriate planning.
- Reducing errors (and error-prone redundant data entry) while improving data integrity.
- Increasing the speed and performance of data retrieval and analytics by planning for capacity and growth.
- Setting and tracking target key performance indicators tailored to your business objectives.

It's not just about the results of data modeling, but how you get those results.

## Data modeling 3 Levels

Now that you know what data modeling is and why it’s important, let’s look at the three different types of data modeling concepts as examples.

### Conceptual data modeling

Conceptual data model
Conceptual data models give a big picture view of data. 

They explain the following:

- What data the system contains
- Data attributes and conditions or constraints on the data
- What business rules the data relates to
- How the data is best organized
- Security and data integrity requirements
- The business stakeholders and analysts typically create the conceptual model. It is a simple diagrammatic representation that does not follow formal data modeling rules. What matters is that it helps both technical and nontechnical stakeholders to share a common vision and agree on the purpose, scope, and design of their data project.

### Logical data modeling

Logical data models map the conceptual data classes to technical data structures. They give more details about the data concepts and complex data relationships that were identified in the conceptual data model, such as these:

- Data types of the various attributes (for example, string or number)
- Relationships between the data entities
- Primary attributes or key fields in the data
- Data architects and analysts work together to create the logical model. They follow one of several formal data modeling systems to create the representation. Sometimes agile teams might choose to skip this step and move from conceptual to physical models directly. However, these models are useful for designing large databases, called data warehouses, and for designing automatic reporting systems.

### Physical data modeling

Physical data models map the logical data models to a specific DBMS technology and use the software’s terminology. For example, they give details about the following:

- Data field types as represented in the DBMS
- Data relationships as represented in the DBMS
- Additional details, such as performance tuning
- Data engineers create the physical model before final design implementation. They also follow formal data modeling techniques to make sure that they have covered all aspects of the design.

## Q2. How data modeling concepts impact analytics ?

Data modeling, data science, and data analytics all go hand-in-hand—you need a quality data model to get the most impactful data analytics for effectual business intelligence that'll inform your future decision-making. The process of creating a data model involves forcing each business unit to look at how they contribute to their holistic organizational goals. Plus, a solid data model means optimized analytics performance, no matter how large and complex your data estate is—or will become.

With all your data clearly defined, analyzing exactly the data you need becomes much easier. Because you’ve already set up the relationships between data attributes within your data model, it’s simple to analyze and see impacts as you change processes, prices, or staffing.
