## Q1. What is data modeling?

Data modeling is the process of analyzing and defining all the different data types your business collects and produces, as well as the relationships between those bits of data. By using text, symbols, and diagrams, data modeling concepts create visual representations of data as it’s captured, stored, and used at your business. As your business determines how data is used and when, the data modeling process becomes an exercise in understanding and clarifying your data requirements.

## The benefits of data modeling

By modeling your data, you can document what types of data you have, how you use it, and the data management requirements surrounding its usage, protection, and governance. The benefits of data modeling include:

- Creating a structure for collaboration between your IT and business teams.
- Revealing opportunities for improving business processes by defining data needs and uses.
- Saving time and money on IT and process investments through appropriate planning.
- Reducing errors (and error-prone redundant data entry) while improving data integrity.
- Increasing the speed and performance of data retrieval and analytics by planning for capacity and growth.
- Setting and tracking target key performance indicators tailored to your business objectives.

It's not just about the results of data modeling, but how you get those results.

## Data modeling concept examples

Now that you know what data modeling is and why it’s important, let’s look at the three different types of data modeling concepts as examples.

### Conceptual data modeling

A conceptual data model defines the overall structure of your business and data. Used for organizing business concepts, your conceptual data model is defined by your business stakeholders and data engineers or architects. For instance, you may have customer, employee, and product data and each data bucket, known as entities, has relationships with other entities. Both the entities and the entity relationships are defined within your conceptual data model.

### Logical data modeling

A logical data model builds upon the conceptual data model with specific attributes of data within each entity and the relationships between those attributes. For instance, Customer A buys Product B from Sales Associate C. This is your technical model of the rules and data structures as defined by data engineers, architects, and business analysts, helping drive decisions about what physical model your data and business require.

### Physical data modeling

A physical data model is your specific implementation of the logical data model created by database administrators and developers. It is developed for a specific database tool and data storage technology, and with data connectors to serve the data throughout your business systems to users as needed. This is the “thing” the other models have been leading to—the actual implementation of your data estate.

## Q2. How data modeling concepts impact analytics ?

Data modeling, data science, and data analytics all go hand-in-hand—you need a quality data model to get the most impactful data analytics for effectual business intelligence that'll inform your future decision-making. The process of creating a data model involves forcing each business unit to look at how they contribute to their holistic organizational goals. Plus, a solid data model means optimized analytics performance, no matter how large and complex your data estate is—or will become.

With all your data clearly defined, analyzing exactly the data you need becomes much easier. Because you’ve already set up the relationships between data attributes within your data model, it’s simple to analyze and see impacts as you change processes, prices, or staffing.
