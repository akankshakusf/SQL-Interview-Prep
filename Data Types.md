- **SMALLDATETIME**: Date and time with a precision of 1 minute.  
  - Stores date and time values. Range: 1900-01-01 to 2079-06-06.

- **DATETIMEOFFSET**: Date and time with time zone offset.  
  - Stores date and time values with time zone offset information. Range: 0001-01-01 to 9999-12-31, with offsets from -14:00 to +14:00 hours.

## Character and String Data Types

- **CHAR(n)**: Fixed-length character string with length `n`.  
  - Stores fixed-length non-Unicode characters. Length specified by `n` (1-8,000).

- **VARCHAR(n)**: Variable-length character string with maximum length `n`.  
  - Stores variable-length non-Unicode characters. Maximum length is `n` (1-8,000) or VARCHAR(MAX) for up to 2 GB.

- **TEXT**: Variable-length character data (deprecated in favor of VARCHAR(MAX)).  
  - Stores large variable-length non-Unicode data.

- **NCHAR(n)**: Fixed-length Unicode character string with length `n`.  
  - Stores fixed-length Unicode characters. Length specified by `n` (1-4,000).

- **NVARCHAR(n)**: Variable-length Unicode character string with maximum length `n`.  
  - Stores variable-length Unicode characters. Maximum length is `n` (1-4,000) or NVARCHAR(MAX) for up to 2 GB.

- **NTEXT**: Variable-length Unicode character data (deprecated in favor of NVARCHAR(MAX)).  
  - Stores large variable-length Unicode data.

## Binary Data Types

- **BINARY(n)**: Fixed-length binary data with length `n`.  
  - Stores fixed-length binary data. Length specified by `n` (1-8,000).

- **VARBINARY(n)**: Variable-length binary data with maximum length `n`.  
  - Stores variable-length binary data. Maximum length is `n` (1-8,000) or VARBINARY(MAX) for up to 2 GB.

- **IMAGE**: Variable-length binary data (deprecated in favor of VARBINARY(MAX)).  
  - Stores large binary data.

## Other Data Types

- **BIT**: Integer data type that can be 0, 1, or NULL.  
  - Stores Boolean values (0 or 1).

- **UNIQUEIDENTIFIER**: Globally unique identifier (GUID).  
  - Stores globally unique identifiers in a 16-byte value.

- **XML**: XML data type for storing XML data.  
  - Stores XML data. Allows for querying and modification using SQL Serverâ€™s XML functions.

- **JSON**: JSON data type (handled as NVARCHAR, but Azure SQL has JSON functions for parsing and querying).  
  - Stores JSON-formatted strings using NVARCHAR. Supports querying and manipulating JSON data with SQL Server JSON functions.
